## _colab
Welcome to _colab!

This section will provide a basic overview of _colab, including our public repos, projects and useful resources for the manufacturing community to leverage the benefits of data sciecne and Industry 4.0.

### Course -- Data Science for Manufacturing
[Data science for manufacturing course](https://dsmanufacturing.github.io/) by the University of Edinburgh & University of Strathclyde will introduce different data science concepts, including data engineering, interactive programming notebooks, analytical methods (for tabular and image data), stats and machine learning.

### Tools -- MODBUS Data Parsing into Python
This repo will demonstrate combining open source industrial IoT tool [Modpoll](https://www.modbusdriver.com/modpoll.html) to pull data from a manufacturing process directly into Python for data exploration and inferencing.
