Welcome to the National Manufacturing Institute Scotland (NMIS) Digital Factory public GitHub for technical documentation related to our smart factory research projects.

### Resource Efficient Supply and Manufacture Environment

NMIS plans to produce a suite of connected manufacturing systems to enable a Resource Efficient Supply and Make Environment (RESuME). The vision for RESuME is to demonstrate to businesses of all sizes what can be achieved by digitalisation and systems integation at different ISA-95 levels of manufacturing i.e. Sensors/Signals, PLC, SCADA/HMI, Manufacturing Execution Systems and Enterprise Resource Planning. The aim will be to create a suite of intelligent and connected systems in order to illustrate and test the possibilities for a streamlined supply chain network within Scotland.
