# Introduction to Python

Python is high-level general purpose programming language that is free to use.

It supports different types of programming concepts (co-called paradigms) and can be applied to many different appliations, from data science to sensor aquisition.

What perhaps sets Python aside is how brilliantly it is supported from a widespread and dedicated community. This allows toolkits to be developed (or 'libraries') that contain functions you may need, especially for data science.

Other languages for data science exist, like R which was actually developed with staticians in mind. Python tends to be the language of choice for a lot of industries and researchers due to the flexbility and availability of online resources.

Our focus will not be on the Python language itself, but its application to data science. Unfortunately that means we will need to learn a bit about Python before we get to that stage!

Python is best learnt by practice and developing good strategies to test your code that will minimise the time you spend frustrated online.

The intention of these tutorials is to develop into a 'toolkit' to develop skills in data science. For our current and future online-only environment, this is challenging. The audience may also vary from University to industry so this is very much a testing phase. If anyone would like to help develop this then please let me know.
