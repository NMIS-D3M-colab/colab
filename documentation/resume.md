## Resource Efficient Supply and Manfacture Environment

NMIS plans to produce a suite of connected manufacturing systems to enable a Resource Efficient Supply and Make Environment (RESuME). The vision for RESuME is to demonstrate to businesses of all sizes what can be achieved by digitalisation and systems integation at different ISA-95 levels of manufacturing i.e. Sensors/Signals, PLC, SCADA/HMI, Manufacturing Execution Systems and Enterprise Resource Planning. The aim will be to create a suite of intelligent and connected systems in order to illustrate and test the possibilities for a streamlined supply chain network within Scotland.

### Networks

### Storage
The aim of the storage is to provide the fundamental data storage infrastructure to provide a centralise repository for all data collected, whether it is structured or unstructured and to any scale. The storage system will be on-site with a central storage location within NMIS while other NMIS facilities send data to the central storage. These other NMIS facilities will have some storage capabilities but will be of a much smaller scale and only for use in a network downtime event between centralise site and themselves. All storage hardware will be viewed as single source with a global namespace reachable anywhere on the network. 


The data lake will be created using software-defined storage which abstracts storage resources from the underlying hardware allowing for faster scalability, flexibility, and efficiency. This software will provide additional functions such as automation of tasks (hot/cold data hierarchy, meta data, data backup, etc) and simplified administration/orchestration of storage. The data lake will contain data collect from machinery, sensors, data analytics, manufacturing enterprise resources, enterprise resource planning systems, etc. As the data is centralised in one storage solution with a global namespace, it will allow a simpler integration with software tools to maximise the value of the data.
